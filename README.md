## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this challenge, my hardest task was the adjust the image and the description of product to screen size appropriate, instead use \<img> tag, I used a tag with _background-img_, this estrategy is common but hard too when we have to resize the components.

How I did what I saw:

```html
<!-- html into <main id="main"></main> tag -->
<div class="image-prod" alt="perfume image"></div>
```
```css
/* a part of page's css */
#container {
  max-width: 35rem;
  height: 28rem;

  display: flex;
  align-items: center;

  border-radius: 0.5rem;
}

.image-prod {
  background: var(--bg-image);
  background-size: cover;
  width: 50%;
  border-radius: 0.5rem 0 0 .5rem;
  height: 100%;
}
```

The JS was not necessary.
